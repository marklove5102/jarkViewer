7.  **📋 Copy Image**: `Ctrl + C`
8.  **🖨 Print**: `Click` on bottom-left window corner / `Ctrl + P`
9.  **🎞️ Browse Frames**: Use top control bar / `J: Previous Frame` `K: Pause/Resume` `L: Next Frame`
10. **⌨️ Space Key**: If viewing a static image, switches to next image. If viewing an animation, toggles pause/play.
11. **✂️ Split animation**: Press `Ctrl + S` to save each frame of the animation as a separate still image file.

## 🖨 Print/Edit

The print function allows simple adjustments to image `contrast`, `brightness`, `inversion`, etc., before deciding to **Save As** another image file or **Continue Printing**.

You can also select color modes: `Color`, `Gray`, `Document`, `Dithering`.

1.  **Document**: Balances overall brightness, highlights text, and avoids the visual impact of local shadows. Suitable for printing images of photographed text documents.
2.  **Dithering**: Simulates pixel grayscale values using the distribution density of pure black pixels. This mode is suitable for dot-matrix and thermal printers and can also produce good image results.

## 🗃️ Features

1.  🍀 Fully static linking compilation, native portable single file
1.  ✅ Automatically remembers last window position/size
1.  ♟️ Chessboard background for image transparent areas
1.  📖 Supports reading prompt parameter information from open-source AI-generated images. Images output by StableDiffusion WebUI and ComfyUI typically contain embedded prompt parameters or workflow JSON. However. ⚠ if the images are re-encoded through circulation on various online platforms, this information may be removed.

## 👋 Quick Start

1. Download the latest version at [Releases](https://github.com/jark006/JarkViewer/releases).

2. Install by `winget`
```sh
winget install jark006.jarkviewer
```

3. Install by `scoop`
```sh
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/jarkviewer
```

> ⚠ Note: If encounter a missing `MSVCP140.dll` error during startup, please download and install the VC++ runtime: [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

## ⚠ Minimum System Support

1. Only `64-bit` `Windows 10` or later are supported.
2. The CPU must support the `AVX2` instruction set:
	1. Intel 4th generation (Haswell) and later CPUs (since 2013).
	2. AMD Ryzen series and later CPUs (since 2017).

## 🛠️ For Developers

When cloning the repository source code, only the latest commit is necessary as historical commits contain many space-consuming redundant files.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:jark006/JarkViewer.git --depth=1
```

**⭐️ It is recommended to visit the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/jark006/JarkViewer) page of this project, which has more detailed explanations and development-related content, and can help you quickly understand the implementation logic of each module.**

This project is developed using `Visual Studio 2026`, with all third-party libraries statically linked. Developers need to prepare all third-party static library files before compilation. Please download the corresponding version of the third-party static library archive from the link below and extract it to the specified location according to the instructions.

Static Library Download: [https://github.com/jark006/JarkViewer/releases/tag/static_lib](https://github.com/jark006/JarkViewer/releases/tag/static_lib)

With the exception of `OpenCV`, the static libraries above were copied from libraries installed via vcpkg. The OpenCV static library compilation baseline instruction set is AVX2, meaning it only supports `Intel 4th generation` / `AMD Ryzen series` and later CPUs. The following main modifications were made:
1.  In source file `opencv-4.12.0\modules\imgcodecs\src\loadsave.cpp` lines #68-79, removed the image resolution limit.
2.  In source file `opencv-4.12.0\modules\highgui\src\window_w32.cpp` line #337, changed `IDC_CROSS` to `IDC_ARROW`, i.e., not using a crosshair cursor inside `cv::imshow()` windows.

If you prefer not to use the above static libraries, you can enable `vcpkg` support in the project properties and manually install the third-party libraries. (This list may not be updated promptly if new dependencies are added later; developers may need to install additional packages based on compilation error messages.)

```sh
vcpkg install x265:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install libyuv:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install exiv2[core,bmff,png,xmp]:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install libavif[core,aom,dav1d]:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install libjxl:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install libheif[core,hevc]:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install libraw[core,dng-lossy,openmp]:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install lunasvg:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install ffmpeg:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install opencv4[core,contrib,freetype,ipp,jasper,jpeg,jpegxl,nonfree,openexr,opengl,openjpeg,png,tiff,webp,world]:x64-windows-static
